# The Kitchen Routing System
You are tasked with writing a piece of software to do a Restaurant Order Routing. Assume that you have
a restaurant with multiple POS (point-of-sale) instances sending orders that should be routed to specific
areas of a kitchen.

It must comprise a HTTP Server with an endpoint to receive an Order and place it in a queue
representing a destination kitchen area.
